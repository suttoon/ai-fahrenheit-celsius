###
<p align="left">This project provides a Python implementation using TensorFlow to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit degrees using a neural network. The neural network is trained with a dataset that relates temperatures in Celsius degrees to their equivalents in Fahrenheit degrees. Once trained, the network can perform accurate conversions based on user input.</p>
