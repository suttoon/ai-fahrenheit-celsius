<h2 align="left">Description</h2>

###

<p align="left">This project provides a Python implementation using TensorFlow to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit degrees using a neural network. The neural network is trained with a dataset that relates temperatures in Celsius degrees to their equivalents in Fahrenheit degrees. Once trained, the network can perform accurate conversions based on user input.</p>

###

<h2 align="left">How the code was created</h2>

###

<p align="left">The code was created using TensorFlow, an open-source library for machine learning and neural networks. A sequential neural network with multiple hidden layers and an output layer was implemented. The configuration of the neural network is done using the high-level Keras API, which is integrated into TensorFlow.</p>
